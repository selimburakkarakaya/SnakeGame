# SnakeGame

This JavaScript game implements a snake game. The player controls the snake, trying to eat the food while avoiding colliding with the snake itself or the edges of the playing field.

How does it work?

1. Initial Condition: The snake is initially located in a certain position and does not move. Additionally, a food is placed on the playing field.

2. Playground and Controls: The user uses the keyboard or controls on the playfield to control the snake. The snake moves in the direction it moves.

3. Eating Food: Once the snake reaches the piece of food, it eats the food and grows along it. Additionally, the player's score increases.

4. Game Over: If the snake collides with itself or the edges of the playing field, the game ends. The user sees his own score and the highest score on the playing field.

5. Replay: Once the game is over, the user is given an option to replay.

Features:

- Keeping Score: The user earns points by eating the snake's food. The highest score is stored using browser local storage.

- Food Random Placement: Food is placed in a random location on the playing field. This ensures that every game is different.

- Snake Movement: The snake is moved by the user's keyboard controls or controls on the playing field. The snake moves up, down, left or right.

- Playground Boundaries: The edges of the playfield determine the boundaries within which the snake can move. If the snake goes out of the playing field or collides with itself, the game is over.

- Replay: Once the game is over, the user is given the option to restart the game.

This game provides a fun experience while helping users improve their reflexes, coordination and strategic thinking abilities.
